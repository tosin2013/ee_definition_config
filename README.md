## Running this on a container
This is NOT Recomended to do, it will run all containers in privledged mode. "user root inside of a container will have the same access as root on the host system"
Building an EE will work if on a container, the following option needs to be changed in the Automation controller.
/var/lib/awx/venv/awx/lib/python3.9/site-packages/awx/settings/defaults.py
```text
DEFAULT_CONTAINER_RUN_OPTIONS = ['--privileged','--network', 'slirp4netns:enable_ipv6=true']
```

Afterward restart automation-controller and nginx service

The container to then use to run is quay.io/acme_corp/ansible-runner
